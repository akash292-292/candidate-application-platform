This README describes a React application with implemented search filters for a job board platform. These filters enable users to refine their job search based on specific criteria.

Features:

Company Name Filter: Users can search for jobs by entering the company name (case-insensitive).
Location Filter: Users can filter jobs based on the desired location (case-insensitive).
Minimum Experience Filter: Users can specify a minimum experience requirement (in years) to find suitable jobs.
Job Role Filter: Users can filter jobs by selecting a specific job role (e.g., frontend, backend, full-stack).
(Optional) Minimum Salary Filter: You can uncomment the code for minimum salary filtering if needed (refer to implementation details below).
Implementation:

The application uses React and Material UI (MUI) for building the user interface (UI) components.
The filtering logic is implemented using JavaScript, iterating through the job data and applying filters based on user selections.
Case-insensitive matching is used for company name and location filters.
Filtered jobs are displayed dynamically based on the applied filters.
Dependencies:

React
@mui/material
@emotion/react
@emotion/styled (if using styled components with MUI)
Instructions:

Clone this repository.
Install dependencies using npm install.
Start the development server using npm start.
The application will run on http://localhost:3000 (or the default development port).
Further Enhancements:

Implement pagination for handling large numbers of job postings.
Add sorting functionality for jobs (e.g., by date, salary).
Integrate with an actual job board API for real-time data fetching.
